# IP Scanner


### Background
This Qapp pings all the IPs in a subnet (/24 to /31) specified by the user from the Netbrain Front server and generates a report with the DNS name (if available) of the all the IP that responded back to pings. 

### Use Case
During commissioning of IP addresses it is always a good practice to check for active IPs on the subnet. This Qapp allows the designer/engineer to have a report of all the active IP address on the subnet.  

#### <ins><span style="color:red">Important</span></ins>:  
1. Netbrain Front Server needs to have access to the subnet of interest.
2. Devices needs to have the ability to respond to ping.
